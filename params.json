Prerequisites for the build:\r\n * .NET framework v4.5\r\n * Visual Studio 2015 Enterprise (includes IntelliTest)\r\n2. Download the zip or clone the repository.\r\n3. Open the Visual Studio solution found in the Source folder as Administrator.\r\n4. Build the whole solution. This triggers two pre-build events:\r\n * Downloading the required NuGet packages.\r\n * Invoking the PowerShell script that copies the necessary Pex assemblies into the corresponding folder.\r\n","google":"UA-69898803-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
